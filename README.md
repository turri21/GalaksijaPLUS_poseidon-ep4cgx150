# Galaksija PLUS FPGA core for Poseidon-EP4CGX150 (WIP)

This port has been made thanks to the following sources: 

It is mainly based on the corresponding core for MiST created by [Gehstock](https://github.com/Gehstock/Mist_FPGA/tree/master/Computer_MiST/Galaksija_MiST).

Several elements such as the keyboard handling have been added from [hrvach](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Galaksija_MiSTer)'s port to MiSTer.

The ROM D addition is based on [GALe - Galaksija Emulator](https://galaksija.net/)*

Finally, several improvements have been migrated from the respective port for the [Senhor](https://github.com/turri21/Senhor) board (MiSTer clone).

## Galaksija first model.

It is possible to disable the ROM C (PLUS model) and ROM D by entering the following command in BASIC:
A=USR(&1000)

## ROM info

Enables ROM C: A=USR(&E000)

Enables ROM D: A=USR(&F000)

---

To use the monitor (RAM dump) you have to type in BASIC the following command:

*A &STARTING_ADDRESS &ENDING_ADDRESS

Example:
*A &F00 &FFF

or simply
*A &F00

and then ESC to break it 

To use the disassembler you have to type in BASIC the following command:
*D &STARTING_ADDRESS &ENDING_ADDRESS

Example: 
*D &F00 &FFF

or simply
*D &F00

and then ESC to break it
